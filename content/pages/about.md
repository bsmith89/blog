I am an Ecology and Evolutionary Biology graduate student at the University
of Michigan, interested in microbiology, microbial ecology,
mathematical ecology, bioinformatics, metagenomics, software development,
technology, python...  Basically I'm your generic guy-with-a-blog.

I intend to write about all of these things at some point or another.
For more information about how and why I put this blog together check out my
[first post](../initial-commit.html).
