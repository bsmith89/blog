Title: You, Too, Can Host This Website

Loyal readers of this blog (of which I am sure there are exactly zero)
might have noticed that things are looking a little different since yesterday.
That's because I've finally developed my own [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) theme
to the point that it's functional, and not too embaressing to look at.

It doesn't appear _too_ different—it's certainly still inspired by the
[sample theme][notmyidea]—but now I understand 95% of the code, instead of 5%.
My goal was to simplify the template files and css to the point that I could
customize just about anything with a minimum of work.  I also attempted to
maintain compatability with all of the configuration options supported by the
default theme.

Not that I know why you would want to, but you can read and copy the
[content and configuration files][blog-source] on Github.  The
[theme source code][theme-source] is there as well.

[theme-source]: https://github.com/bsmith89/blog-theme

By putting everything up on Github I make development easy for myself, get
a free, external backup, and give off an air of open-science superiority.

So please, fork my blog.
