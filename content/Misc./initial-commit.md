Hi.

This is mostly a test post and a chance to get some real content on my
brand-new blog.

Inspired by
[C. Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/advice-to-graduate-students.html)'s
tireless pressure to make more graduate student clones of himself—and the
fact that a pretty damn good domain name was still available—I started this
website/blog over the weekend.

I hope that it will turn into a place for me to share my
excitement and views on microbiology, microbial ecology, mathematical
ecology, bioinformatics, python, (very) amateur software development,
etc.  But I will be satisfied if it turns out to just be writing practice.
Heaven knows I need that.

In case you're curious, setup took me about 3 hours (plus some waiting for DNS
updates).  Largely, this is because I'm shamelessly mirroring Titus's well
trafficked blog by using a nifty python application called
[Pelican](http://getpelican.com).  And at $15/year for the domain (using
[Hover][hover-link][^hover-disc] as my registrar) and $35/year for hosting
(tiny, shared server with [A Small Orange][aso-link][^aso-disc],
I really had no financial excuse to not do this.

[^hover-disc]: DISCLOSURE: That's a referral link.  I'll get $2 in credit
  each time one of you nerds signs up.

[aso-link]: http://asmallorange.com/?ref_id=lTryoX47YjmF

[^aso-disc]: That, too, is a referral link.
  My handlers told me to also suggest
  that you use the coupon code 'FRIENDME' for 15% off.

Wish me luck!
