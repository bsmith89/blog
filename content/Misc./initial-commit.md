Hi.

This is mostly a test post and a chance to get some real content on my
brand-new blog.

Inspired by
[C. Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/advice-to-graduate-students.html)'s
tireless pressure to make more graduate student clones of himself—and the
fact that a pretty damn good domain name was still available—I started this
website/blog over the weekend.

I hope that it will turn into a place for me to share my
excitement and views on microbiology, microbial ecology, mathematical
ecology, bioinformatics, python, (very) amateur software development,
etc.  But I will be satisfied if it turns out to just be writing practice.
Heaven knows I need that.

In case you're curious, setup took me about 3 hours (plus some waiting for DNS
updates).  Largely, this is because I'm shamelessly mirroring Titus's well
trafficked blog by using a nifty python application called
[Pelican](http://getpelican.com).  And at $15/year for the domain (using
[Hover](http://hover.com) as my registrar) and $35/year for hosting (tiny, shared
server with [A Small Orange](http://asmallorange.com)), I really had no financial
excuse to not do this.

Wish me luck!

-Byron
