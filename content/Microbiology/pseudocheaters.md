Summary: In which I comment on a recent article with big implications
         for evolutionary medicine.

_I would like to apologize for the long delay since my last post.  The excuse
(I keep telling myself) is that, having already written too many computational
articles, it was time to prove that I could write about biology too.
Unfortunately I'm not nearly as good at reading the literature as I should be.
Anyway, it's done.  You can stop complaining now._

Theory predicts many things.  In a world with infinite possibilities and finite
reality it is sometimes surprising to find that a theory not only accurately
predicts a phenomenon, but that it might have actual applications to human
health.  It is more surprising still when that theory happens to relate to my
work and interests.

I am interested, it just so happens, in evolutionary dynamics of microbial
populations.  A big-picture research goal of mine, and one of the field as a
whole, is developing the tools needed to predict and modulate evolutionary
trajectories of microbes.

One barrier to engineering bacteria for biofuel production or any other human
endeavor is that evolutionary rates are scaled by population sizes and growth
rates.  For an organism with massive population sizes (trillions of individuals
or more) and doubling times on the order of hours, evolution can occur quite
quickly.  Genetic variants within the population which are capable of growing
faster will quickly take over.  For an organism which is, for example, wasting
a huge fraction of its energy producing your future gasoline, you can bet this
months graduate stipend that mutants which put more resources into growth will
sweep the population.

See kids, cheaters _do_ win in the end!   In this example the microbes are
"cheating" the metabolic engineers out of their valuable chemical products, but
the same sort of evolutionary trend: favoring fitness over (and often at the
expense of) any other metric we can think of, has big implications for their
fellow bacteria as well.  My current research is on the impact of selection
on growth rate versus resource use efficiency, but I'll write more about that
some other time.

Many microbial populations engage in cooperative behavior. _Salmonella_
Typhimurium, for instance, a human pathogen, uses a type III secretion system
(imagine bacteria using tiny syringes to pump toxins into your cells) to
induce wide-spread inflamation in the gut.  By pumping enough toxins into your
cells, a population of Salmonella can make a niche for themselves in which
they outcompete the non-pathogenic (commensal) bacteria already present.  Those
syringes are expensive, but without them the Salmonella can't colonize at all,
so everyone works together for the common good.

Unfortunately (for Salmonella at least) evolution doesn't really care about
the common good.  Theoretical models predict that every so often a mutant will
come along which has lost the type III secretion system genes, or doesn't turn
it on as frequently or at such high levels.  Since this new strain doesn't have
to waste resources on producing the costly virulence factor, but can still take
advantage of the inflamation being induced by all his straight-laced bretheren,
he grows faster than all the normal ("wild-type") Salmonella.  Even when it's
_all_ cheaters and the population's ability to inflame the host is greatly
reduced, even when they're all struggling to outcompete the commensal bacteria,
the mutant is still a _little_ better off, because it's not wasting resources
on that silly syringe.

The cheater wins again!  In this example it's not the metabolic engineers
that are being deprived of their liquid fuel, but the wild-type Salmonella
which is being cheated out of its public resource: inflamation.  Of course
winning for the cheater also means that the entire population is wiped out.
Without sufficient inflamation Salmonella can't survive, but up until that last
cell is killed or expelled, at least the cheater was doing better _relative to_
the wild-type.  And, in the short-term, that's what winning _is_ in the Game of
Evolution.

"But wait just a minute", says the astute reader, "why have I been cooking my
eggs all these years if Salmonella can so easily be wiped out by its internal
rebellion?"  Aha!  That's the exact question raised by Médéric Diard and
co-authors in their recent paper, "Stabilization of cooperative virulence by
the expression of an avirulent phenotype."

What they found was that wild-type _Salmonella_ Typhimurium was playing chess
with the mutant, sacrificing a Knight in order to take the King.  Diard et al.
discovered that a fraction of the wild-type Typhimurium population was not
expressing the costly virulence factors.  These are not cheaters; their
genotype is identical to cooperators which _are_ expressing the type III
secretion system.  Their phenotype, however, is identical to the cheaters.  By
choosing to not expend the energy needed for the construction of those  microscopic
syringes, they have the same fitness as the mutant.

It's not a complete equilizer.  Their daughters still have some probability of
expressing the virulence factors (or else they might as well be _real_
cheaters), but their fitness deficit is not as great.  This boost was bought,
however at the price of a reduced population size.  Since only a fraction of
their ranks are producing the public good of host inflamation, the total
virulence of the population is reduced.

"But wait again", you might point out, "just because the fitness benefit of
cheating has been minimized does not mean that it has been eliminated entirely.
The cheaters will still take over the population in the end, no?"  You're
right, cheaters will still grow faster in the long run, since they _never_
cooperate, but **it will require additional time for them to take over**.

The rate at which an allele fixes in the population is positively related to
the relative fitness of that allele and therefore the cheater will not fix as
quickly.  In a pathogen like Salmonella, the ultimate goal is to infect a new
host.  If the cooperators can sustain a sufficiently large population for long
enough, their host is likely to pass them on to another unsuspecting (and
un-hand-washing) individual.  The cheater's success was all for nothing;
without the type III secretion system, the mutant will never colonize another
host.  While they may have won the figurative battle, they lost the war.
They've painted themselves into a corner.  (Insert additional cliches here.)

Diard et al., in their article, do some fantastic simulations, showing all of
the dynamics at play.  I encourage you to check it out.  One of the most
exciting sentences is the second-to-last (see, a snoodier author would have
said "penultimate"): to conclude their paper, the authors point out that this
tendency for mutants to out compete the wild-type pathogen, and therefore
reduce the negative effects on the host, suggests a potential therapy: treat
those suffering from Salmonella with a large dose of cheaters!
