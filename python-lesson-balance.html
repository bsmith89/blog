    <p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong> I tried out a <a href="https://gist.github.com/bsmith89/5eeb9e7da35bd6b8bf28ae884f6478ff">modified Python lesson</a>
and I think it was successful at balancing learner motivation with teaching
foundational (and sometimes boring) concepts.</em></p>
<p>In many ways, <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">teaching Python to scientists</a>
is easier than just about every other audience.
The learning objective is clear: write code to make my science more accurate,
more efficient, and more impactful.
The motivation is apparent: data is increasingly plentiful and increasingly
complex.
The learners are both engaged and prepared to put in the effort
required to develop new skills.</p>
<p>But, despite all of the advantages, teaching <em>anybody</em> to program is hard.</p>
<p>In my experience, one of the most challenging trade-offs for lesson planners
is between motivating the material and teaching a mental model
for code execution.
For example, scientists are easily motivated by simple data munging and
plotting using <code>pandas</code> and <code>matplotlib</code>;
these are features of the Python ecosystem that can convince a graduate
student to pay attention to the material instead of answering emails.
Actually <em>using</em> these features, however, requires a long list of basic
concepts: Python syntax, libraries, function calls, objects and methods,
conditionals, and variable assignment, to name just a few.</p>
<p>A lesson planner can start from the basics, working in to these features
along the branches of the dependency tree, but that could require hours
(or even days) of "boring programming".
It's all too easy to dismiss learners who lose interest before you get
to the good stuff, but it is more a reflection of the materials and
instructor, than the students.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, a lesson could start with working code,
or, in the Software Carpentry style the instructor could lead learners
through writing code that uses these features, before the concepts have
been fully introduced.
This in-at-the-deep-end approach quickly demonstrates exciting uses of Python,
but at the risk of intimidating learners, making them wonder if they're the
only one in the room who's confused by what's going on under the hood and what
all of the syntax means.
I'm not aware of any studies on this topic (if you are, please pass them my
way), but I'm willing to speculate that this second approach has
a higher risk of subjecting learners from underrepresented groups to stereotype
threat, a major risk when teaching a subject with a pervasive diversity
problem.</p>
<p>Luckily for us all, there's a whole spectrum of approaches in between the
motivations-first and foundations-first extremes.
We can trust learners to self-motivate for a time, especially when we're
teaching scientists.
Attendees are there voluntarily (I would hope).
Likewise, learners will never have a perfect understanding of how their code is
working, regardless of how long you spend teaching the basics.
The key is to avoid unintentionally teaching pathological mental models that
are difficult for the instructor to diagnose and iterate beyond.</p>
<h1>State of the Python lesson</h1>
<p>As of this writing, the current default Python lesson for Software Carpentry is
<a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/">"Novice Inflammation"</a><sup id="fnref-inflammation-commit"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-inflammation-commit">1</a></sup>.
I have <a href="//blog.byronjsmith.com/swc-python-lesson.html">written previously</a> about my experience
with the lesson, and have not been shy with my criticism.
There is a <em>lot</em> to be positive about in the composition of Inflammation.
It has been an effective approach to teaching Python to what at this point
must be several thousand workshop attendees.</p>
<p>However, this post is about how we can do better.
My primary criticism focuses on the first section:
<a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/01-numpy/">"Analyzing Patient Data"</a>.
The approach here falls towards the motivation-first extreme.
Learners are shown how one might go from raw data in a CSV to heatmaps
and line plots, two useful skills.</p>
<p>The downside, however, is that this happens without fully explaining the
syntax, what libraries are, <code>numpy</code> arrays versus Python lists, <code>dtypes</code> vs
built-in Python types, and more.
I think that by using this particular motivating example while glossing over
those details we're giving learners a challenging mental model to iterate
beyond.
What's more, I believe that this results in a <em>diversity</em> of models
making later instruction more likely to leave some learners behind.
Novice Inflammation also gets stuck in the weeds over difficult concepts which,
in my opinion, aren't nearly as important for learners, for example,
accumulating over particular axes in <code>numpy</code> arrays.</p>
<p>For this and other reasons Greg Wilson spearheaded an attempt to
reinvent the Python lesson.
The <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/">"Novice Gapminder" lesson</a><sup id="fnref-gapminder-commit"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-gapminder-commit">2</a></sup>
is a from-scratch re-write.
It's worth noting that SWC's normal pull-request model for lesson development
is unable to accommodate a major overhaul like this one.</p>
<p>Gapminder is different in several ways, for instance using <code>pandas</code> as a focal
library instead of <code>numpy</code>.
Notably for this commentary, though, it also takes a much more gradual approach
to motivating the material.
<code>pandas</code> and <code>matplotlib</code> are not introduced until the end of the first
half-day,
and only <em>after</em> a thorough discussion of variable assignment, functions, and
data types.
The Gapminder lesson also appears to lack the distractions and rabbit holes
that I've criticized in Inflammation.</p>
<p>Overall, I think Gapminder hits a superior balance between motivation
and basics, while also improve the structure and refining the details.
I have to applaud everyone who's contributed to its development.
I've now taught from the new lesson once, and co-instructed a workshop that
used the first half.
The improvements in the design were apparent both times.
I expect it to be well received by the SWC community when it becomes the
default.</p>
<h1>Continual improvement</h1>
<p>That's not to say, however, that it cannot be improved.
The same motivation-vs-foundations question has already come up in
<a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder/issues/113">a discussion on GitHub</a>.
A proposal was made to delay the use of <code>pandas</code> and <code>matplotlib</code> until the
second half, further front-loading the basics.
My personal opinion, having taught the lesson is that
this is unnecessary.
With the Gapminder lesson, by the time we got to these more advanced topics at
the end of the first half-day, learners appeared to be ready for the material,
comfortably updating their mental models in an appropriate way.
And, thankfully, I also didn't notice a loss of engagement due to the delayed
pay-off.</p>
<p>Like many trade-offs in lesson design, the optimal position on the
motivations/foundations spectrum is context dependent.
I would focus on cool application instead of basic concepts
for the first session if I were
teaching high school students or any learners skeptical about the utility of
the material.
A room full of scientists who were there specifically to learn Python, however,
could probably tolerate even more front-loading of syntax and control-flow.
A framework to help instructors customize the materials for their audience
would be a very useful addition.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this post is to nominate a slightly different approach
which introduces an advanced example early in the lesson without the
risk (I believe) of intimidating learners.</p>
<p>In December 2016 I co-instructed a (not officially SWC)
<a href="https://umswc.github.io/2016-12-14-umich/">workshop</a> which taught Python over two half-day sessions to
about 20 learners, primarily graduate students in the biological sciences.</p>
<p>My co-instructor, Jackie Cohen (<a href="https://twitter.com/jczetta">\@jczetta</a>),
taught the first half-day using the Gapminder lesson.
The positive reception from learners to the first half of the material was
testament not only to her skillful instruction, but also the quality of the
design.</p>
<p>I then taught the second day with the
same gapminder dataset and covering the same
topics as the normal materials, but using <a href="https://gist.github.com/bsmith89/5eeb9e7da35bd6b8bf28ae884f6478ff">a custom lesson plan</a>.
Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder/issues/113#issuecomment-256230540">a comment</a> on the Gapminder GitHub repository,
I constructed a "realistic" analysis of the gapminder data
as a Jupyter notebook.
In particular, the notebook includes code to generate a fairly involved
figure telling a story about the relationship between per-capita GDP and
life-expectancy.</p>
<p><img alt="An example visualization of the gapminder data." src="//blog.byronjsmith.com/static/images/gapminder-analysis.png"></p>
<p>I started the second day by having learners download and run this notebook,
demonstrating the quality of analyses they could produce with fewer than 100
lines of code.
By <em>not</em> live-coding, and <em>not</em> expecting the learners to type along during the
introduction, I believe this approach minimizes the likelihood of intimidating
the learners with syntax.
To that end, I also did not walk through the code itself, but instead focused
on describing the overarching flow of the analysis:
loading external data, selecting a subset, plotting two columns as a
scatter-plot with a third column determining the size of the points, running a
linear regression, and plotting a best-fit line.
The purpose of this introduction was purely to motivate the material, not
to introduce the concepts.</p>
<p>I then had them open a new, empty notebook, and the remainder of the lesson
(which <em>was</em> done in the traditional live-coding style)
then revolved around reconstructing the same analysis from scratch,
a thematic unification, that I found to be elegant.
Since the pre-constructed analysis made use of for-loops, if-statements,
and functions, I was able to limit my use of foo/bar style examples and
quickly return to the core analysis demonstrating the use of these elements
in a realistic setting.
Our workshop was advertised as an introduction to Jupyter notebooks, data
manipulation, and plotting, (as well as novice Python) so a significant
fraction of the time was spent on these topics and libraries instead of more
foundational concepts.</p>
<h1>Where to go from here?</h1>
<p>I found this approach to be quite successful.
In-person and exit survey feedback has been uniformly positive and
learners appeared to have achieved most or all of the learning objectives
of the core Gapminder lesson.
While the "realistic analysis" approach sounds more like the
<a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>
style, in this particular case it was a great fit for the Software Carpentry
learning objectives.</p>
<p>I believe that this model could be implemented in the core Gapminder lesson,
perhaps starting in the second half (as we did), or with a different
example notebook for each half-day.
That would, however, entail modifying most or all of the sections to
focus on the new unified example.
Is it worth expending the tens of hours required to implement it?
Even if it were implemented, I'm not convinced that the SWC lesson development
model makes this kind of large-scale refactoring feasible.</p>
<p>As an alternative to submitting a pull request,
I'm hoping that I can convince a few instructors to try it out for themselves.
Positive experiences with an unofficial fork makes patching the main branch a
more rational investment.
I've already been <a href="http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss/2016-May/004529.html">evangelizing</a> in a similar way for an
<a href="https://github.com/bsmith89/git-novice-outline">alternative Git lesson</a>,
sharing my immature outline and encouraging folks to try it out
themselves.
Is there a better approach to making medium to large changes to the design of
a SWC lesson?</p>
<p>In conclusion: I think we need additional discussion (and data) about the
motivations/foundations trade-off in our lessons.
I'd also like to hear your thoughts on the best way to lobby for and introduce
moderately sized changes to the core materials.
What do you think about my approach?
If you're feeling brave, please try it out and let me know how it goes!</p>
