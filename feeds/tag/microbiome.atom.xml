&lt;p&gt;My goal is to write a small blurb for each item, explaining what it is,
how it connects to other items, why I'm grateful for it,
when, and why I first learned about it.
I may add additional links in future edits.
Beyond that, I'll likely leave further discovery up to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dependency Graphs (e.g. GNU Make, Snakemake)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many computer people have used GNU Make (or one of its variants) to build
software, but not everyone realizes that it is actually a much more generally
applicable tool.
Make's core idea is that every file that you want to construct requires zero
or more other files as prerequisites.
When you have multiple files, and some of them are prerequisites of
each other, you end up with a directed, acyclic graph describing all of the
chains of dependency.
This description is encoded in Make's domain specific language (DSL) in a
&lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this dependency graph is that it directly implies optimal
procedures for a whole bunch of useful operations.
First, and most useful, for any target file and set of existing files, Make can
determine the sequence of file constructions that will get from A to B.
As a corollary, it can also determine what &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; need to be built
given what already exists.
If you tack on instructions for building each file from its prerequisites, Make
can run those procedures for you automatically.
And if you have timestamps for each file, it can update files only when they're
out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this was originally designed for software compilation, it works just
as well for data workflows (or building static HTML for a blog...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since discovering the power of the dependency graph representation and tooling,
I've since upgraded to Snakemake, which fills some additional gaps that come up
in bioinformatics, but is exactly the same concept.
At this point, the Snakefile is the core of all of my (computational) research
projects, and provides me with a version-controlled, and highly modular,
description of all of the steps in my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I need to thank C. Titus Brown for introducing me to Make, probably
in summer of 2011 while I was rotating in his lab (but maybe later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Probabilistic Programming (e.g. PyMC3, Pyro)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since first learning about model based inference, at ELME in 2012,
I've been enthralled with frameworks that allow me to take full advantage
of the modularity and flexibility of graphical models without
programming the core algorithms from scratch.
It was actually the process of learning PyMC3 that taught me almost everything
I now know about Bayesian statistics (with a foundation of key concepts
imparted by many other teachers along the way).
Having access to such a powerful DSL makes graphical modeling the hammer for
which I now see an abundance of nails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently I've started to use Pyro (a different probabilistic programming
framework) as well.
While it was a chore to reshape my mental model of probabilistic programming
with a whole new ecosystem, that has undoubtedly been a valuable learning
experience, and the incredibly fast, GPU accelerated, stochastic gradient
descent algorithms for MAP estimation have been a breakthrough for my research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly have no idea who first introduced me to PP, but based on my
GitHub I was teaching myself PyMC3 starting in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Containers (e.g. Docker, Singularity)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newest item on this list (as of December 2020)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers take what Conda promised (encapsulated, reproducible
software environments), and actually deliver it.
I think the Docker/Singularity combo may have finally solved all of my
software installation problems... Lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hard one to assign thanks, because containerization has been
marketed to me by probably five different people since 2014 or so.
Very grateful that I finally picked it up in 2020!
Should I also thank the incredibly frustrating experience of trying to install
PyMC3/Theano (on a slightly outdated CentOS server, repeatedly, every 6 months)
for finally convincing me to try it out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Command-line / UNIX&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thankful that I have a glue environment, the UNIX command-line,
for all of my computational work.
Working with a command-line interace (CLI) is foundational for all of the
other headings in this "Computing" section.
I'm (as of now) not including Vim as a separate item, but it really is the
combination of Bash and (Neo)Vim that I'm most grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure who to thank for this one. Maybe Google, because they sent me a
free Chromebook in the early days (which I used extensively for college
work until the wi-fi broke...).
It was hacking around on that Chromebook's terminal that got me into Linux,
and ultimately resulted in me replacing Windows with Ubuntu on my main laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably wouldn't be the scientist that I am now if it weren't for that
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/519/"&gt;Relevant XKCD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Python&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that I'm capable of programming, I'm capable of programming in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad that I know at least one language very well.
I think it makes me a
better teacher (of Python, but also of other languages).
I think it makes
it easier for me to learn new languages and programming concepts.
And I almost never need to decide what language to work in when I'm
doing something complicated; it's always Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for introducing me to Python goes to Dr. John Hayes, a postdoc
(neuroscientist) I worked with briefly while I was doing undergraduate research
in Margaret Saha's Lab at The College of William &amp;amp; Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Functional Programming&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a Haskell beginner, maybe intermediate depending on who you ask.
I don't do any of my work in Haskell, although I sometimes look for
opportunites.
On the other hand, almost &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of my programming is in a functional style.
I think (without any empirical evidence) I've probably saved myself a lot of
problems by taking pains to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never reuse variable names for different things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid mutation ("in the large")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use higher-level functions and composition instead of conditionals to control
  program flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep side-effects away from core logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Plain-text&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple text-files and a smattering of UNIX tools will take you 2/3rds to
being a bioinformatician.
Text files are the ultimate form of portability and I believe they should be
used until there is a good reason not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Software Carpentry is probably responsible for my positive relationship
with plain-text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Version Control (e.g. Git)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If most of your work is plain text, you also get to use version control for
tracking your progress, archiving, sharing, collaboration, and fancy
branching that sometimes comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very thankful for having been introduced to Git by Software Carpentry.
It has saved my ass many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Jupyter notebooks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter Notebooks (and their kin) are great, but only for prototyping and
interactive work; never for reproducible automation.
Notebooks are a core part of my workflow, and the exploratory data analysis
phase of my work is very much done in the Jupyter environment.
On the other hand, my love of workflow managers like Snakemake means that
I try to keep interactive work at the "tips" of my data processing DAG.
Notebooks are a great place to do prototyping, but the second I need the
resulting data for a downstream step it's probably time to convert it to a
script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to IPython by Greg Wilson and IPython (now Jupyter) Notebooks
by C. Titus Brown during my first Software Carpentry class in 2012.
I'm thankful for all of the work that has gone into making Jupyter Notebooks
the phenomenal tool that they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Organic Chemistry&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think having first-principles knowledge about how biology is built out of
chemistry has served me very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure there's much more for me to say than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Neutral Evolution / Spandrils&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything is adaptive (e.g. I'm 99% sure eye color doesn't affect survival
or reproduction.)
Not everything that seems adaptive, even when there's evidence for convergent
evolution, actually is.
It's incredibly infuriating to see so many Appeals to Natural Selection
(a new logical fallacy I'm naming here first, 2021-01-18) in our
general discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some traits are due to random events (neutrality).
Some traits are a natural consequence of physical reality (spandrils).
I'd guess these are important parts of a full answer to a key question in my
field: "why do animals have such fancy microbiomes?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to guess, I learned about both neutral evolution and spandrils first
in my evolutionary biology class in college.
I'm sure I can figure out who taught that class if I dig into my emails,
but I'm going to put that off for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Microbial Communities&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt that the research I did in high school with Dr. May Voytek at
the USGS (in 2006 and 2007) was one of the most important experiences for my
career development.
I was enthralled then&amp;mdash;as I am now&amp;mdash;with the ways in which microbial
metabolisms can combine in complex communities to perform immensely important
processes.
Microbiomes are a great example of an emergence, and I find that very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Linear Algebra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true what they say. Linear Algebra is the core of statistic(al computing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned linear algebra, in a course by that name, my sophomore year of
college,
and have taken a number of courses since then that improved my competence
markedly.
These include mathematical biology classes at W&amp;amp;M (2010?),
graduate level statistics courses
(2012?), and a class on matrix population models in ecology taught by Hal
Caswell (2012).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Graphical Models&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My introduction to graphical models were back-to-back one-week workshop on
maximum likelihood estimation and structural equation modeling taught by Colin
Kremer and Don Schoolmaster, respectively, during two sessions of ELME
("Enhanced Linkages between Mathematics and Ecology") at Kellogg Biological
Station in the summer of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modularizing probability into graphs of relationships between latent
and observed variables is incredibly powerful and is the basis for the
entirety of my statistical understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bayesian Statistics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not the elegance of Bayes's Rule that I'm enamoured with;
it's how Bayesian statistics &lt;em&gt;democratizes&lt;/em&gt; inference (e.g. the Inference
Button).
If you have a data generating model and some data, you can make
logically consistent statements about it's parameters.
&lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; you get propagation of uncertainty for free!
How cool is that??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first material impact on my understanding of Bayesian stats
was probably in Statistics for Ecologists (was that the class name?),
taught by Dr. Ian Dworkin at Michigan State University.
ELME also played a key role in priming me to understand what Dr. Dworkin was
teaching, although I still only got a whiff of the importance.
It was probably another 4+ years before I learned enough basics to
start calling myself a Bayesian by self-teaching PyMC3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Causal Inference&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am by no means fully competent with causal inference, but I aspire to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that we can automate the scientific method
(&lt;code&gt;observation -&amp;gt; hypothesis -&amp;gt; experiment&lt;/code&gt; and all its variations), has been
super influential on the way I think about my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to do more of this in the coming data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Learning Objectives / Concept Inventories&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like the truism that I don't know how to attribute: "The most important
part being able to play a song, is knowing how it goes".
The most important part of teaching is knowing what you are teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest mistake that I've made (and seen made) as a teacher
is not knowing what I'm trying to teach.
Explicit and carefully vetted learning objectives, especially those written
using best practices
(i.e. "At the conclusion of this activity, participants will be able to...")
are a key tool to solve this problem.
Following that with simple questions that (A) assess whether those objectives
have been met, and (B) identify exactly how students' understanding is lacking,
is the real win.
Collections of those questions, called "concept inventories", can (and should
be) shared as a key component of collaborative lesson development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I have to thank Greg Wilson and Software Carpentry instructor training
(in 2016?) for opening my eyes to the power of this combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Expert Bias&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more we know about a subject the harder it is for us to empathize with
those just starting to learn it.
(See Cognitive Biases, below)
I see it everywhere and staying self-aware about how it limits my
ability to teach has been really important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another one I picked up from Greg Wilson and Software Carpentry
training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Learning By Teaching&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me (and undoubtedly many other people too), I learn something the best
when I have to teach it.
This served me very well during my undergraduate genetics class when
Nishant Kishore and I would cram the night before a test by me "teaching" him
the material to the extent that I had understood it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compounds with other ideas in pedagogy, like Expert Bias, and I think
its a big part of why the Think-Pair-Share tactic works so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Growth Mindset&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels incredibly powerful to see your current self as just a single stage
in the development of your full capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I really first learned this in Multivariate Calculus my sophomore
year; I distinctly remember how gratifying it was to go from absolutely zero
understanding to a B-minus on the final; a bad grade relative to my other
classes but I'm very proud of it nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that I am a work in progress is both liberating and empowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Deficit Model of Persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who disagree with you about the way the world works often have all the
same facts as you do.
We don't convince people of our world view by giving them more facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this depressing. But on the flip side you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be much more effective
at persuasion by doing two key things (to my limited understanding):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share your emotional reasons for your beliefs
  (e.g. I'm super &lt;strong&gt;excited&lt;/strong&gt; to be able to travel and hug my parents again
  after they and I are vaccinated for COVID-19.
  I've been &lt;strong&gt;scared&lt;/strong&gt; about their safety, and vaccination feels like an
  opportunity for &lt;strong&gt;optimism&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate that their community shares that belief.
  This is usually done by making them part of &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; community.
  (I think it's really great that &lt;strong&gt;our&lt;/strong&gt; family/college/neighborhood has
  really come together to get everyone vaccinated.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is obviously key for science communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Privelege&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing my advantages has been really helpful in building empathy for
disadvantaged groups in the world.
I'd like everyone to have the same access and opportunities for success and
contribution that I have had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably internalized this sense circa 2015...ish.
Not sure if there's any one person to thank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Talking About Yourself (e.g. "I feel..." Language)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that my interpersonal relationships have been bolstered by
a mutual ability to communicate about our own feelings instead
of claiming some objective sense of reality ("I am... You are...").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can say with some certainty that communication is much more likely to
transition into a fight when I break this rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize this is common advice, but it has served me well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cognitive Biases&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially the "Fundamental Attribution Error".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly because I am also subject to all of the same biases, but also
because it helps me to understand peoples' behavior, even at large scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Profit and Monopoly&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I have a hobbyist's understanding of economic theory.
As I understand it, in an idealized world (perfect market efficiency) no
producer should be able to make a marginal profit in the long run.
Obviously this is not really the case, since e.g. doctors are making
great money for their time.
I think it's fascinating that in many (most?) cases where value is being
captured by a small group of people this can be assigned to some sort of
monopoly power.
For instance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doctors have the American Medical Association controlling the supply of
  medical labor,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genentech has various patents and corporate secrets, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISPs have both cartel power and huge barriers to entry in most regions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monopolies aren't all evil (left as an exercise to the reader).
Appropriately regulating these monopolies seems to me to be a key
role of governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Intentional Communities&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this millennium, many people (including me) are suffering from less community
than the previous one.
This would appear to be due to geographic mobility (loss of family and
friends), secularization, an extended youth, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it has been empowering to realize that we can choose to have those
communities if we're willing to work for it.
Intentional communities (e.g. communes, kibbutzim) prove it, and give me
something to aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Getting Things Done (GTD)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't actually use the GTD system, so why is this one on the list?
For me, GTD taught me to use to-do lists as a plan for the day, rather than
(only) record-keeping about what I need to do.
Specifically GTD introduced me to the tactic of giving myself a short list of
&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; the tasks that are currently a priority, and using my own behavior to
re-assess if things are &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To-do lists can serve other purposes as well, but motivation and prioritization
are two key ones for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Habits&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very much believe that the most important factor in whether or not we
demonstrating self-control in our lives is the degree to which we actually
have to flex that muscle.
Habits are an important way that we can unload the weight of "I should really
do X" while &lt;em&gt;still doing X&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rituals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me at least, lots of the stress in life comes from worrying or thinking
about things in a non-productive way or over which I don't have control.
Rituals have been valuable for me in putting clear landmarks in my
day/week/year that allow me to reset my mental state.
Many of them are also just enjoyable on their own.
Some key rituals that come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading the news as I wake up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making/drinking coffee in the morning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ending the core of my workday with a beer/cocktail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washing my hands thoroughly when getting to work, home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going for a run/walk without a schedule or destination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooking an expansive dinner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yearly&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traveling to be with my family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep-cleaning my home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still want to be intentional about building more of these into my life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc."></category><category term="software-carpentry"></category><category term="teaching"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="open science"></category><category term="microbiome"></category><category term="rant"></category><category term="evolution"></category><category term="pipelines"></category><category term="software"></category><category term="git"></category><category term="containers"></category></entry><entry><title>Changes to the gut microbiome resulting from acarbose treatment are associated with increased longevity in mice</title><link href="//blog.byronjsmith.com/acarbose-longevity-preprint.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-01T12:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-20T15:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Byron J.

## Introduction
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm excited to announce that we've posted a
&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/311456"&gt;preprint of our latest manuscript to the bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;,
as well as submitted it for peer review to the open access journal Microbiome.
I'll update this note if and when it gets accepted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 2019-06-20: Our submission to Microbiome was tranferred to BMC
Microbiology, and was finally accepted (more than a full year in review!).
&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-019-1494-7"&gt;Check it out in print&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days it seems like the only research more over-hyped than
"microbiome" is &lt;em&gt;longevity-enhancement&lt;/em&gt;.
It is therefore with some trepidation that I have released into this world of
buzz the first chapter of my dissertation, titled:

## Introduction
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm excited to announce that we've posted a
&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/311456"&gt;preprint of our latest manuscript to the bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;,
as well as submitted it for peer review to the open access journal Microbiome.
I'll update this note if and when it gets accepted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 2019-06-20: Our submission to Microbiome was tranferred to BMC
Microbiology, and was finally accepted (more than a full year in review!).
&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-019-1494-7"&gt;Check it out in print&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days it seems like the only research more over-hyped than
"microbiome" is &lt;em&gt;longevity-enhancement&lt;/em&gt;.
It is therefore with some trepidation that I have released into this world of
buzz the first chapter of my dissertation, titled:
"Changes in the gut microbiota and fermentation products associated with
enhanced longevity in acarbose-treated mice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous work (done by my co-authors on this paper as well as others) has
conclusively demonstrated that treatment with the anti-diabetic drug acarbose
&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12170"&gt;substantially increases lifespan in mice&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12496"&gt;also&lt;/a&gt;).
The magnitude of the effect in males&amp;mdash;where it's the most
pronounced&amp;mdash;puts it on par with rapamycin and 17-&amp;alpha;-estradiol, two
drugs that have gotten heavy interest from the longevity-enhancement crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
TODO: Link to this buzz.
--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the approximately 20% increase in median lifespan in males is not as big
as dietary restriction (a whopping ~40% in several studies), and the effect
is much less in females (only 5% give-or-take) this still represents an
exciting potential therapy if it can be reproduced in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, it represents another tiny toehold in the still inscrutable
field of longevity science.
(Disclaimer: &lt;em&gt;I am not a longevity expert.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To drive home how little we understand about longevity, not only do we have
just a rudimentary understanding of
&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.02.020"&gt;how dietary restriction increases lifespan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:dr-mechanism-note"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dr-mechanism-note"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,
but we can't even say if acarbose (or any other therapy) has a similar
mechanism of action.
It seems reasonable to expect that it might;
acarbose inhibits the enzymes that break down starch, reducing the uptake of
glucose after a meal.
However, the physiological response to long-term treatment with the drug is
quite distinct from dietary restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discrepancy has inspired an alternative hypothesis: looking instead to the
starch left undigested and that therefore enters the &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; digestive system
in much larger amounts.
If this increased supply of substrate for microbial fermentation causes an
increased production of "good" bacterial products&amp;mdash;for instance short-chain
fatty acids (SCFAs)&amp;mdash;then this could result in improved health and,
ultimately, longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Concept diagram: our alternative model for acarbose's effect on longevity.
" src="//blog.byronjsmith.com/static/images/longev_concept.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features and limitations of our study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this hypothesis, we have been very fortunate to collaborate
with the National Institute on Aging's
&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/interventions-testing-program-itp"&gt;Interventions Testing Program (ITP)&lt;/a&gt;, an
ongoing multi-institutional study that trials promising anti-aging therapies
in large mouse cohorts.
The life-extending properties of acarbose were first observed in this study,
and subsequent mouse cohorts have both confirmed the original finding and built
on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My manuscript is based on the analysis of fecal samples from these mice,
measuring the concentrations of three key SCFAs and other metabolites as
well as the composition of the bacterial community.
Longevity studies like these are challenging simply because you're waiting
for your mice to die naturally.
This is both time consuming and expensive;
you need quite a few mice for statistical reasons, and they can live for years.
To my knowledge, ours is the first study to combine characterization of the
fecal microbiome with longevity measurement in normal, healthy mice.
Another valuable feature of our study is the pairing of chemical analysis with
community characterization in the same samples, presumably improving
our ability to detect associations between bacterial taxa and their
fermentation products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, as with any research this study has crucial limitations
and is only the first step in process of validating an exciting
hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we did not set out to test the central, causal claim of our model:
    that SCFAs in the gut increase lifespan.
    To do so would require experimental control of one or more of the three key
    SCFAs in the lower digestive system&amp;mdash;acetate, butyrate and
    propionate&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; independently affecting mouse physiology.
    While a useful manipulation, acarbose supplementation has other major
    effects (on blood glucose, for instance) and therefore does not qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, by definition, the mice for which we obtained fecal pellets had
    survived up to the time of collection.
    Since samples were collected from mice nearing to the median lifespan of
    the control mice,
    our interpretation are therefore limited to &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, this was a purely cross-sectional study with a single sample
    collected from each mouse.
    We can answer the most pressing questions without longitudinal sampling,
    but variation within each mouse, on the time-scale of hours, days, or
    weeks, surely introduced noise and decreased our statistical power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we only measure chemical and community composition in &lt;em&gt;feces&lt;/em&gt;.
    While this is an effective proxy for the gut microbiome, and a huge
    fraction of studies accept this shortcoming, it is important to remember
    that fecal SCFA concentrations may not reflect bacterial production, nor
    exposure of the gut and other host tissues to these compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interesting findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study explores predictions of the hypothesis that acarbose
increases longevity via the bacterial production of short-chain fatty acids,
finding that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acarbose treatment modifies the composition of the gut microbiota,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;variation in the abundance of particular bacterial community members
is associated with variation in the concentration of fermentation products,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one or more of the major SCFAs are increased in the feces of acarbose
treated mice, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCFA concentrations are associated with mouse lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our model does not supersede the more mainstream hypothesis that
acarbose acts to increase longevity through its effects on glucose homeostasis
pathways, our work is important support for an alternative model in which the
microbiota plays a central role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know all the juicy details, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/311456"&gt;read the paper&lt;/a&gt;.
Here, however, I want to expand a little bit on some
of the less obvious bits that I think are worth your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quantification of bacterial density&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting methodological feature of our 16S rRNA gene survey is the
inclusion of an internal DNA standard for the purpose of comparing the absolute
abundance of the bacterial population between samples.
This approach has been published in the past (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-016-0175-0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.02.003"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but is not widely implemented.
Normally, sequence based surveys of bacterial communities are limited to
comparing the relative abundance of particular amplicons.
By spiking in a known amount of defined DNA&amp;mdash;in this case
10 &amp;mu;L of a stationary phase culture of &lt;em&gt;Sphingopyxis alaskensis&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;we
can compare population density of bacteria per gram of feces
based on the recovery rate of the exogenous 16S gene.
Since we can uniquely identify and remove the foreign sequence,
this approach is fully complementary to a relative-abundance based analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use this tool to confirm that observed increases in the relative abundance
of several taxa reflect increases in their population size, rather than
the decreased abundance of other bacteria, a distinction that is impossible
to make with standard survey methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study we did not attempt to quantify the density of bacteria in the
spike itself, which means that our abundance estimates are in units of
spike-equivalents rather than gene copies.
This does not affect our interpretations, although it can create challenges for
communication.
We skipped this step because it is probably not possible to accurately estimate
cell counts in the endemic community based on 16S rRNA gene density.
Extraction and amplification efficiency, as well as
&lt;a href="https://rrndb.umms.med.umich.edu/"&gt;16S rRNA gene copies per cell&lt;/a&gt;, vary among species.
Instead we depend on an assumption of per cell copy number invariance in the
community on average, as well as in the specific taxa being assessed.
For this reason, we've opted to use "spike-adjusted abundance" as a euphemism
for the estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to write more about this approach in the future.
For now I'll just say it was a small, but valuable feature of our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identification of bacterial function&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting method that I'm proud to have included was a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)"&gt;LASSO regression&lt;/a&gt; of metabolite concentrations on taxon abundances.
Our reason for doing this was the belief that the bacteria
most strongly correlated with particular fermentation products were the most
likely to be producing them.
This na&amp;iuml;ve approach appears to have paid off;
the method identified contenders for these functional roles that, in many
cases, match &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; expectations.
For instance, the most abundant &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; was closely associated with
lactate concentrations.
(Surprised?)
Likewise, the dominant members of the &lt;em&gt;Muribaculaceae&lt;/em&gt; appear
to be predictive of propionate concentrations, matching functional annotations
of genomes from this family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are almost certainly better methods for discovering the taxa that
produce particular metabolites,
but LASSO regression is a surprisingly simple approach and sufficient to
demonstrate a relationship between bacterial abundances and SCFAs,
while being (theoretically) more robust to other sources of co-linearity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A reproducible paper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the joy of having contributed to SCIENCE,
I am also proud to declare that the results&lt;sup id="fnref:but-one"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:but-one"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in our manuscript
are recreate-able by sufficiently interested readers.
Raw sequence data are available from the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA448009"&gt;SRA&lt;/a&gt;, and everything
else&amp;mdash;HPLC peak area tables, mouse survival data, and all of the relevant
metadata&amp;mdash;can be found in a &lt;a href="https://github.com/bsmith89/smith2018paper"&gt;public GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.
That repo also comes with all of the pipeline
code, implemented as scripts and a Makefile, for raw data
processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who doesn't want to install a bunch of software and
reserve about a hundred hours of CPU time
to reprocess our sequences, intermediate results are available in a preloaded
SQLite database.
Finally, Jupyter notebooks with code to reproduce published figures and
statistics have also been included.
I'm not providing a prepared container, unfortunately, and some of the
required software can be challenging to install.
Once that's done, though, the Makefile is designed to generate the finished
paper with a single invocation of &lt;code&gt;make paper&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there's an "official", current release of that repository,
&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1229203"&gt;checkpointed by Zenodo&lt;/a&gt;,
I may implement patches if they make results easier for readers to recreate.
If anyone out there wants to get really crazy, I'll even take pull-requests!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This manuscript is a key chapter of my PhD thesis, and I'll be building off of
the findings in subsequent work.
So stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except for one: Our supplemental materials do not included the code

        that the population of mice from which we sampled recapitulate the
        sex-specific longevity effects of acarbose.
        This result was computed by a collaborator and uses longevity data
        that will be released with a different paper, currently in
        preparation.
        I believe that this particular result is a relatively minor part
        of our story, confirming a previously observed, and well

That same survey found only 74% of respondents believe that a healthy diet
can include moderate amounts of sugar, down from 84% in 2013.
If these trends lead to decreasing calorie consumption as a whole, we could
see a decline in obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there may be an unintended consequence of these quickly
shifting attitudes.
The fraction of Americans that are actively trying to consume fiber and whole
grains in their diet dropped to 53% in 2014 from 62% the year before.
Dietary fiber is also a carbohydrate, made-up of individual sugars combined
like daisies into long chains and branching structures.
What makes these carbohydrates special is that, due to the links holding them
together, the human body is not capable of breaking fiber down into
individual sugars to be absorbed into the blood stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any way to digest it, fiber is often thought of as an inert component
of our food, increasing feelings of fullness but not contributing to the
calorie content, all while improving our digestive health by absorbing water
and pushing everything smoothly along.
While some of the benefits of fiber consumption may be due to its inertness,
the problem with that description is that it entirely ignores the multitudes
of microbes living in our gut, collectively referred to as the microbiome.
Many of these bacteria can break down and feed on dietary fibers, in the
process, producing a huge variety of byproducts.
The discomfort and flatulence associated with the consumption of beans, for
instance&amp;mdash;or in lactose intolerant individuals, milk&amp;mdash;is due to the
carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas belched out by trillions of microbes in the
large intestine while they feast on carbohydrates inaccessible to our bodies.
Despite the discomfort, the breakdown of these compounds by fermentation
produces a number of small molecules called short-chain fatty acids, each of
which you can already recognize by smell: acetate (the acid in vinegar),
lactate (which gives cheese its sharpness), propionate (similar to body
odor), and butyrate (the distinctive stink of vomit).
Despite its odious stench, butyrate has a number of
&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2007.03562.x"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, notably its ability to reduce
inflammation, a fact that should come as welcome news to the almost
&lt;a href="http://www.ccfa.org/assets/pdfs/updatedibdfactbook.pdf"&gt;2 million&lt;/a&gt; Americans who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases.
The ability of these fibers to stimulate the growth of certain beneficial gut
bacteria puts them into the category of dietary supplements called
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prebiotic_(nutrition)"&gt;"prebiotics"&lt;/a&gt; (rather than probiotics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, diabetics have been prescribed a drug called acarbose to temper
the glucose spikes that occur after starch-heavy meals.
Acarbose operates by blocking the breakdown and absorption of starch,
effectively (and unintentionally) transforming it into dietary fiber to be
broken down by the bacteria in our gut.
Unsurprisingly, flatulence and diarrhea are commonly reported side effects.
A little discomfort might be worth it, though, if the &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acel.12170"&gt;finding&lt;/a&gt;
that treatment with acarbose extends lifespan in mice&amp;mdash;by as much as
20%&amp;mdash;applies to humans as well.
Why it has this effect is unclear, but if it is due to the increased
production of butyrate by gut bacteria, increased fiber consumption could
have similar effects.
Studies are currently underway testing the longevity effects of inulin, a
dietary fiber from chicory root.
If this and other fibers also increase lifespan in mice, butyrate, and by
extension the microbiome, will be new targets for the growing field of
life-extending therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Biology"></category><category term="longevity"></category><category term="microbiome"></category><category term="diet"></category><category term="popular science"></category></entry></feed>
