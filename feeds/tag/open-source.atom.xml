That’s because I’ve finally developed my own &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; theme to the point that it’s functional, and not too embaressing to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t appear &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; different—it’s certainly still inspired by the &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/notmyidea-cms"&gt;sample theme&lt;/a&gt;—but now I understand 95% of the code, instead of 5%. My goal was to simplify the template files and css to the point that I could customize just about anything with a minimum of work. I also attempted to maintain compatability with all of the configuration options supported by the default theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I know why you would want to, but you can read and copy the &lt;a href="https://github.com/bsmith89/blog"&gt;content and configuration files&lt;/a&gt; on Github. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/bsmith89/blog-theme"&gt;theme source code&lt;/a&gt; is there as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By putting everything up on Github I make development easy for myself, get a free, external backup, and give off an air of open-science superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please, fork my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
