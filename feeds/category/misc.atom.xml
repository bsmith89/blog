might have noticed that things are looking a little different since yesterday.
That's because I've finally developed my own &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; theme
to the point that it's functional, and not too embaressing to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't appear &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; different—it's certainly still inspired by the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/notmyidea-cms"&gt;sample theme&lt;/a&gt;—but now I understand 95% of the code, instead of 5%.
My goal was to simplify the template files and css to the point that I could
customize just about anything with a minimum of work.  I also attempted to
maintain compatability with all of the configuration options supported by the
default theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I know why you would want to, but you can read and copy the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/bsmith89/blog"&gt;content and configuration files&lt;/a&gt; on Github.  The
&lt;a href="https://github.com/bsmith89/blog-theme"&gt;theme source code&lt;/a&gt; is there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

a free, external backup, and give off an air of open-science superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is mostly a test post and a chance to get some real content on my
brand-new blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by
&lt;a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/advice-to-graduate-students.html"&gt;C. Titus Brown&lt;/a&gt;'s
tireless pressure to make more graduate student clones of himself—and the
fact that a pretty damn good domain name was still available—I started this
website/blog over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that it will turn into a place for me to share my
excitement and views on microbiology, microbial ecology, mathematical
ecology, bioinformatics, python, (very) amateur software development,
etc.  But I will be satisfied if it turns out to just be writing practice.
Heaven knows I need that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you're curious, setup took me about 3 hours (plus some waiting for DNS
updates).  Largely, this is because I'm shamelessly mirroring Titus's well
trafficked blog by using a nifty python application called
&lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.  And at $15/year for the domain (using
&lt;a href="https://hover.com/JRw4YQne"&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref-hover-disc"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-hover-disc"&gt;1 …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISCLOSURE: That's a referral link.  I'll get $2 in credit
  each time one of you nerds signs up.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-hover-disc" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-aso-disc"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, too, is a referral link.
  My handlers told me to also suggest
  that you use the coupon code 'FRIENDME' for 15% off.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-aso-disc" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
